I specialize in accessibility with my web development endeavors and practice what I preach.

I strive to conform to level AA of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). This website has been built with standards-compliant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I conduct automated and manual testing ensure accessibility.
